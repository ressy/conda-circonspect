.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Circonspect (Control In Research on CONtig SPECTra) was designed to create
contig spectra based on the assembly of random subsets of metagenomes. The
contig spectra can then be modeled downstream to get diversity estimates (for
example with \s-1PHACCS \s0(http://sourceforge.net/projects/phaccs). Different kind of
contig spectra can be created: the standard contig spectrum for alpha-diversity,
the mixed contig spectrum, for gamma-diversity, and the cross-contig spectrum,
for beta diversity. Building a cross-contig spectrum requires building a mixed
contig spectrum, which requires building normal contig spectra based on several
selected metagenomes (\s-1FASTA\s0 files). Circonspect uses a indexed sequence
database to store temporary data. Any assembly program that support a minimum
overlap length and similarity is adapted; at this time, Minimo, \s-1TIGR\s0
Assembler, \s-1LIGR\s0 Assembler, \s-1CAP3\s0 and Newbler are supported. When multiple
repetitions are done (bootstrapping), the average contig spectrum is
calculated. The user can control the size of the sequences by trimming them to
a given length and removing sequences smaller than a threshold.
