Revision history for Circonspect

0.2.6   08-Feb-2013
        Default output file renamed <basename>.csp instead of <basename>-basic.txt
        Using Math::Random::MT instead of Math::Random::MT::Perl for speedup
        New script to convert CSP files to CSV

0.2.5   08-Aug-2010
        Migrated to git
        Fixed bug that allowed -r and -k to be specified all together although
          they are exclusive

0.2.4   15-Aug-2010
        Fixed bug that caused the number of sequences to use to be often wrong
          when using the metapercent (-p) option in combination with mixed or
          cross-contig (-g or -x)
        Fixed utility average_contig_spectra: now properly putting the results
          on screen or in a file depending on user request
        Improved utility average_contig_spectra:
          * warning message if the input file is not a Circonspect detailed
            results file
          * average contig spectra are now in same order as in the input file

0.2.3   06-Aug-2010
        New option (-o) to output Circonspect results in a file instead of the
          standard output
        New utility script to calculate the average contig spectrum for an
          unfinished/interrupted circonspect computation
        Fixed bug in batch utility script: now also computing the last control
          cross-contig spectrum
        Fixed bug that caused the sample size to occasionally be higher than the
          metagenome size when using 100% of the genome size (-p 100)

0.2.2   21-Jul-2010
        Support for exporting the contigs in the contig spectra and cross-contig
          spectra to ACE-formatted files
        More accurate calculation of cross-contig spectra
        Requesting a cross-contig spectrum now causes a mixed contig spectrum to
          be produced and returned
        Inclusion of a bash script to automate cross-contig spectra
        Output now shows a description of the fields
        New default parameter: minimum coverage = 1 x
        Better handling of default options mixed with user input.

0.2.1   19-Feb-2010
        Minor bugfix concerning the use of the detailed output file

0.2.0   17-Dec-2009
        Re-engineered the contig spectrum calculation so that is done one contig at a time, thus
          greatly reducing the memory footprint
        Support for more assemblers: TIGR Assembler, LIGR Assembler, Minimo, Newbler and CAP3
        Fixed bug that miscalculated the number of repetitions to do when also using sequence
          trimming
        Dissolved and cross-contig spectra are now calculated using the assembly parameters specified
         to the assembler, not the effective assembly parameters (calculated from the contigs created)
        Change in the results displayed on screen: showing the specified minimum overlap, not the
          effective minimum overlap
        Default values are now: Minimo assembler, 35 bp minimum overlap, 98 % minimum identity,
          100 bp discard, 100 bp trim, sample size of 10000 sequences
        New option to calculate and write or not the effective assembly parameters in the detailed
          output file
        The Circonspect Perl module now returns the average contig spectra and detail of the contig spectra
        Updated dependencies (bioperl and external assemblers)
        Tests added

0.1.4   21-Sep-2009
        Fixed impossiblity of seeding properly the random number generator (Math::Random::MT::Perl)
        Capability of filtering out low complexity sequences
        Fixed incorrect calculation of cross-2+-contigs spectra (Bio::Assembly::Tools::ContigSpectrum)

0.1.3   24-Feb-2009
        Better sequence import
        Support for compressed files: .gz .Z .bz2 .zip
        Program wrapped as a CPAN module with installer

0.1.2
        Better random numbers

0.1.1
        Separated the program into a part to call from the command-line and a Perl module

0.1.0
        Initial Release
