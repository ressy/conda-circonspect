Circonspect

Circonspect (Control In Research on CONtig SPECTra) was designed to create
contig spectra based on the assembly of random subsets of metagenomes. The
contig spectra can then be modeled downstream to get diversity estimates (for
example with PHACCS (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phaccs). Different kind of
contig spectra can be created: the standard contig spectrum for alpha-diversity,
the mixed contig spectrum, for gamma-diversity, and the cross-contig spectrum,
for beta diversity. Building a cross-contig spectrum requires building a mixed
contig spectrum, which requires building normal contig spectra based on several
selected metagenomes (FASTA files). Circonspect uses a indexed sequence
database to store temporary data. Any assembly program that support a minimum
overlap length and similarity is adapted; at this time, Minimo, TIGR
Assembler, LIGR Assembler, CAP3 and Newbler are supported. When multiple
repetitions are done (bootstrapping), the average contig spectrum is
calculated. The user can control the size of the sequences by trimming them to
a given length and removing sequences smaller than a threshold.

INSTALLATION

You need to install these dependencies first:
  * Perl (http://www.perl.com/download.csp).
  * The Minimo assembler, distributed in the AMOS package >=2.0.9
    (http://sourceforge.net/projects/amos/) (or the current development version
    if this version is not yet released:
    cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@amos.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/amos co -P AMOS)
  * Other optional assemblers:
    - LIGR Assembler (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ligr-assembler/)
    - TIGR Assembler v2 (ftp://ftp.tigr.org/pub/software/assembler/)
    - CAP3 (http://seq.cs.iastate.edu/)
    - 454 De Novo Assembler, a.k.a Newbler (http://www.454.com/products-solutions/analysis-tools/gs-de-novo-assembler.asp)

At this point, you should be able to run the assembly program by typing its name
(Minimo, LIGR_Assembler, TIGR_Assembler, cap3 and runAssembly respectively) in
a terminal or command prompt. If this doesn't work the assembler is installed
improperly or it was not added automatically to your PATH environment variable
and you should do it manually.

The following Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed automatically
for you during installation:
  * Getopt::Declare
  * Math::Random::MT
  * Graph
  * BioPerl-Live >= 1.6.2 (or the current development version if this version is
    not out yet: http://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-live/tarball/master)
    - Bio::SeqIO
    - Bio::Seq::Quality
    - Bio::PrimarySeq
    - Bio::Root::Utilities
    - Bio::DB::Fasta
    - Bio::DB::Qual
    - Bio::Assembly::Singlet
    - Bio::Assembly::Tools::ContigSpectrum
  * BioPerl-Run >= 1.6.2 (or the current development version if this version is
    not out yet: http://github.com/bioperl/bioperl-run/tarball/master)
    - Bio::Tools::Run::TigrAssembler
    - Bio::Tools::Run::Cap3
    - Bio::Tools::Run::Minimo
    - Bio::Tools::Run::Newbler

To install Circonspect, run the following commands in a terminal or command prompt:

  On Linux, Unix, MacOS:
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    $ make test
    As root user:
    $ make install
    If you do not have administrator rights and want to install the program
    locally, read this tutorial:
      http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/non-root/

  On Windows:
    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ nmake
    $ nmake test
    $ nmake install    (as administrator/root)
   Note that installation will likely require the installation of a compiler,
   which may not installed on your system. It should be done automatically for
   you, but if you encounter installation problems on Windows, try to get a
   compiler from here: http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html

DOCUMENTATION

After installation, you can find the program usage by running the following
command in a terminal or a command prompt:
  Circonspect --help

Example 1: Simple contig spectrum with a FASTA input file (all default parameters)
             perl Circonspect -f 1.fa

Example 2: A contig spectrum based on a FASTA and QUAL file with a sample size
           of 1000 sequences, a metagenome coverage of 1.0, and a detailed output:
             perl Circonspect -f 1.fa -q 1.qual -s 1000 -k 1 -e

Example 3: Same thing as previously, but include a second metagenome and
           produce a cross-contig spectrum. Notice how we a metagenome can be
           used multiple times:
             perl Circonspect -f 1.fa 2.fa 1.fa -q 2.qual 1.qual -s 1000 -k 1 -e -x

Example 4: Creating ACE files for the (cross-)contig spectra. ACE files can be
           large, so perform a single bootstrap that uses as many reads as
           possible (100% of the reads in the smallest metagenome):
             perl Circonspect -f 1.fa 2.fa 1.fa -q 2.qual 1.qual -p 100 -r 1 -e -x -a

The 'utils' folder included in the Circonspect package contains a few utilities
described below:

* reformat_quality_file:
If you want to use quality files, you have to make sure that the quality scores 
are on one line. Use the included Perl utility reformat_quality_file if you need
to convert your quality files.

* batch_cross_contigs.sh:
If you need to generate cross-contig spectra from many metagenomes, you might
find the included BASH script batch_cross_contigs.sh useful. Given a list of
metagenomes, it can calculate the cross-contig spectra between all pairs. The
computation can be split into several jobs that can be run on a multiple-core
CPU or on a cluster. Copy this script in the desired location and edit its
configuration part of this script according to your needs before use.

* average_contig_spectra:
When requesting a large coverage or many bootstraps, Circonspect calculations
can be very long. In the event that a Circonspect computation was aborted, all
hope is not lost. If you requested a detailed output for it, the included Perl
script average_contig_spectra is capable of reading the fragmentary output and
produce the output with average contig spectra that you expect from Circonspect,
albeit using only as many repetitions as were completed before Circonspect was
interrupted.
